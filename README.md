# 1. Loading and Preprocessing Image:
The code loads an image using OpenCV (cv2.imread) from the specified file path.
Converts the loaded image to grayscale using cv2.cvtColor().

# 2. Image Blurring:
Applies Gaussian blur to the grayscale image using cv2.GaussianBlur().
This step helps to reduce noise and smoothen the image, making it easier for subsequent processing steps.

# 3. Thresholding:
Applies Otsu's thresholding method using cv2.threshold() to obtain a binary image.
Otsu's method automatically calculates an optimal threshold value based on the image histogram.
This step converts the grayscale image into a binary image where pixel values are either 0 or 255.

# 4. Finding Contours:
Uses cv2.findContours() to detect contours in the binary image.
Contours are the outlines of objects present in the image.
The function returns a list of contours and a hierarchy representing the relationship between contours.

# 5. Drawing Contours:
Copies the original image (image.copy()) to draw contours on a separate image.
Draws contours using cv2.drawContours() on the copied image.
The contours are drawn with a green color (0, 255, 0) and a thickness of 3 pixels.

# 6. Displaying Images:
Utilizes Matplotlib to display multiple images in a grid layout (subplots).
Displays the original image, grayscale image, binary image, and contour image in separate subplots.
The titles of subplots describe the type of image being displayed.
Axis ticks are turned off for better visualization.

# 7. Additional Points:
Grayscale conversion and blurring are common preprocessing steps before applying thresholding or contour detection algorithms.
Otsu's method is useful for automatic thresholding, particularly in cases where the distribution of pixel intensities is bimodal.
Contours can be used for various purposes such as object detection, shape analysis, and image segmentation.
Overall, the code demonstrates a basic pipeline for image preprocessing, thresholding, contour detection, and visualization using OpenCV and Matplotlib.
